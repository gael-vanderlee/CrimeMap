    "Our topic concerns public safety in our immediate community and can potentially provide  insight on how San Diego can more effectively allocate their resources in order to better protect San Diego civilians. We came up with our hypothesis based on socio-economic biases that lower income regions yield higher crime rates. A good amount of research has been conducted on crime, crime-related costs, and income inequality. However, we are finding there is less research that has been conducted on police dispatch calls in correlation to regional crime. \n",

    "This study conducted research on crime-related events and how said information can provide insight for government and policy-makers when distributing resources for public safety (specifically referencing police budgets). The study measured crime by the amount of money spent in relation to crime-related scenarios, from preventative costs to house market prices to crime reduction costs. In other words, the study made the argument that the more money a region or neighborhood spends on crime, the less crime in that region. Our project follows a similar framework: we are using police dispatch calls to determine the amount of crime. The more calls there are, the more crime there is. This study worked to show the crime related costs in lieu of police hirings and the effectiveness. Our study will relate police calls by region and how the knowledge of these higher-crime regions can help government and policy makers to make changes in police/safety regulations. "

    "*Data Cleaning (2-3 sentences)*\n",
    "The Police Calls Disposition Codes and Police Beats data both only have 2 columns of data, both of which are relevant and contain valid, non-null values, and therefore won’t require cleaning. However, the Police Calls for Services will require much more cleaning. We will remove all rows with 999 in the beat column, because it isn’t a valid code from the Police Beats data and they prevent us from establishing the location of the call. We will also remove irrelevant columns and potentially identifying data columns such as day, time and address, some of which contain NaN values as well. The San Diego Census Tract data has 41 columns, most of which we will not need in our analysis. We will remove the irrelevant columns, along with rows with NA data in the remaining relevant columns, and only keep the necessary columns such as neighborhood, population, poverty rate and unemployment rate. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*Data Analysis (1-2 paragraphs)*\n",
    "We will start by merging the Police Calls for Service, Police Calls Disposition Codes, and Police Beats into a single dataframe. We will then delete the disposition code and beat code columns because we now have the explanations of the codes meanings and no longer need the code itself. Using the neighborhoods, we will merge cleaned Police Calls for Service and San Diego Census Tract data into a single dataframe, which will be the basis of our analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will then create a histogram for the numbers of each severity of call for the neighborhoods to see if there is an obivious trend in the distributions. If needed, we will perform a log transform if the data is highly skewed and needs to be further analyzed. We will then transform this information onto a heat map to get a better visual representation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have completed the analysis of the types of calls, we will move on to look at how other factors are related to crime. To do this, we will create a scatter matrix with income, severity of calls, education and unemployment levels to see if any trends emerge. We may then create separate data frames to map out bar graphs or other forms of charts for these data points so that we can try to analyze which variables are most highly correlated. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*What to report (2-3 sentences)*\n",
    "We will be using a Google API to map the priority and number of calls to the corresponding neighborhoods to create a visual representation in the form of a heat map of what type of crimes tend to occur in what regions. We will also be comparing the population with number of crimes by using a scatter plot to see if there is correlation, and if possible we will map the line of best fit. We will then compare the poverty rates and unemployment rates in a similar manner, using scatter plots to visually determine if there is a correlation present. If we find strong enough correlations with each scatter plot, we may also create a heat map that maps this data to the neighborhoods so that we can compare the heat maps to one another, which may allow us to find additional correlations within regions. \n",
